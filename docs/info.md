## How it works

Our project is a 4x4 array multiplier. It implements two AND gates that go into each box box of the multiplier, a carry wire that comes into the box, carry wire that carries out the box, and a wire that outputs the product of the two inputs. It takes in two four-bit inputs, outputting the eight-bit product.
